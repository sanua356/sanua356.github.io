                    First of all, we would like to start by apologizing to you for not showing the game on base last-gen consoles before it premiered and, in
                    consequence, not allowing you to make a more informed decision about your purchase. We should have paid more attention to making it play
                    better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Second, we will fix bugs and crashes, and improve the overall experience. The first round of updates has just been released and the next
                    one is coming within the next 7 days. Expect more, as we will update frequently whenever no improvements are ready. After the holidays,
                    we'll continue working — we'll release two large patches starting with Patch #1 in January. This will be followed by Patch #2 in February.
                    Together these should fix the most prominent problems gamers are facing on last-gen consoles. We will be informing you about the
                    contents of each patch ahead of their release. They won't make the game on last-gen look like it's running on a high-spec PC or next-gen
                    console, but it will be closer to that experience than it is now.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Finally, we would always like everyone who buys our games to be satisfied with their purchase. We would appreciate it if you would give us a
                    chance, but if you are not pleased with the game on your console and don't want to wait for updates, you can opt to refund your copy. For
                    copies purchased digitally, please use the refund system of PSN or Xbox respectively. For boxed versions, please first try to get a refund at
                    the store where you bought the game. Should this not be possible, please contact us at helpmerefund@cdprojectred.com and we will do our
                    best to help you. Starting from today, you can contact us for a week up until December 21st, 2020.
